the location script add a way for players to show other players coords or share thier own.

/location [me/*blank*] -- shares your location to everyone
/location [playername] -- sends only you the location of a certain player
-- also every effected player gets the glowing effect for 10 seconds.

NEW:
/location convDim -- calculates your current location into either the nether or the overworld.
